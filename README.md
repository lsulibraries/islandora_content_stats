# islandora\_content\_stats

Requirements: islandora, php\_lib, php\_filter


Queries are stored in the mysql database as 'id', 'coll','cmodel', 'count', and 'timestamp'
Admin -> Islandora -> Islandora Utility Modules -> Content Statistics
Press "Run Queries Now" to update database. (must be done after installing)

Queries are updated on a given month and hour when cron is also running.

The last run queries can be found at yoursite.org/data

Data can be downloaded as a csv, with any filters applied to the gui applied to the download.

The last run queries can be found at yousite.com/data or localhost:8000/data (depending on your setup)
The queries can be filtered with the drop-downs found here, by collection, and content model. (Must press "Filter" button to apply)

You can check the "Show all results" box followed by the "Filter" button to see all queries in the history of the repository. (since installing the module)
